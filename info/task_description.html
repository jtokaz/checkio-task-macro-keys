<p>
    A <strong>keyboard macro</strong> allows a sequence of keystrokes to be transformed into another usually 
    longer sequence of keystrokes.
</p>
<p>
    For this task someone has maliciously assigned macros to single letter keystrokes.  If <em>d</em> is 
    assigned to <em>foo</em> and <em>s</em> is assigned to <em>bar</em> then typing "I like dessert" results
    in the screen displaying "I like fooebarbarert". You know what you typed and what you see displayed on
    the screen.  Use your coding skills to determine the minimum number of letters that were assigned macros.
</p>
<p>
    Only letters are assigned macros, and these can be any length including zero.  The upper and lower cases of a letter
    are mapped separately.  The letter <em>A</em> could be mapped to <em>b</em></em>, while <em>a</em> is mapped to 
    <em>bar</em> or not mapped at all.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> The string you typed and the string displayed with macros applied.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The minimal number of macros required to transform the typed string to the displayed
    string.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong> 0 &le; |min_num_macros| &le; 5<br>
